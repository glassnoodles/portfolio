    <!--<h3>Assignment Prompt</h3>
    <p>Use heuristics to do a usability analysis on your website of choice, then redesign it accordingly.  

    I chose the University of Washington’s University Book Store’s website, and focused on the experience of viewing course materials and the check out process.</p>

    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
        <p>Every year, more than 40,000 students attend classes at Seattle’s University of Washington. Many order class materials from the University Bookstore. Is the UI for online purchase effective in allowing users to purchase needed course materials?</p></div>-->

    <div class="right-content"><h3>Project Context</h3>
    <p>The overall project is to encourage students to explore engineering and sustainability as a possible university major and eventual career by giving them materials to build a working mini-wind turbine that generates electricity.</p> 

<p>This project was from Engineers Without Borders, a student-led club at the University of Washington. The club partnered with Renton School District and secured funding from a university group called the Campus Sustainability Fund.</p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I was the co-lead for this project and one of my roles was to design a manual guiding instructors on how to use the club-designed kits. I wrote most of the content with the rest written by other club members. For the design, I worked solo with some feedback from the other project lead. </p>
    
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <div class="split-content-container">
        <div class="left-bar"><p>I prepared the informational content, set the style direction, then designed the manual by drafting with wireframes and creating the final look with Figma.</p>
        </div>
        
    <div class="right-content"><h4>Informational Content</h4>
    <p>I began by listing out what informational content to include, based on our partner’s needs and requests. One important need was our partner school’s lecture-free teaching style and so I wrote educational prompts for instructors to ask and discuss with students. We focused on using brevity and simple language.</p>
    
    <h4>Style Direction</h4>
    <p>After setting up the content, I set a direction for the style. As a manual-type design, I decided to (visually) reference instruction manuals by creating vector-based images, and to make it clean and simple with a sans serif font and 2-color palette.</p>
    <div class="figs figs-part3">
        <img class="fig fig5" src="assembled%20base.svg"><img class="fig fig6" src="styleCleanSans.png"></div>

    <h4>Content Organization for Usability</h4>
    <p>Then, I roughly organized the content on paper, keeping usability in mind (for instance, the assembly instructions and educational prompts are on the same page, so instructors can teach a class with just 1 page of the guide rather than flipping back and forth). I also focused on keeping the page count low so instructors could concentrate of teaching rather than flipping through the manual.</p>
    <div class="figs figs-part4">
        <img class="fig fig7" src="organizationExample.png"></div>
        
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>I started the design with sketched out wireframes, then moved on to Figma for the final look. I went between sketching and Figma a couple times, reorganizing content for a compact use of space. 
    </p>
    </div></div>
  
    <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>Here is the final design. The school will start using the kits and this manual near the tail end of the 2021-22 school year.</p>

        </div>
       
      
        
    <h3 class="recs">Reflection</h3>
    <p>It's so important to be clear when communicating about project goals!</p>
    <p>At first, we planned for the educational component on majors and sustainability to be conveyed through a powerpoint presentation. When our partner first mentioned that their classes would rarely have lectures, and would only short ones when they did, we thought they were asked for a short & condensed powerpoint. However, they actually wanted no presentation at all and we pivoted to educational prompts instead where we wrote discussion questions & answers for the instructors. </p>
