    <!--<h3>Assignment Prompt</h3>
    <p>Use heuristics to do a usability analysis on your website of choice, then redesign it accordingly.  

    I chose the University of Washington’s University Book Store’s website, and focused on the experience of viewing course materials and the check out process.</p>

    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
        <p>Every year, more than 40,000 students attend classes at Seattle’s University of Washington. Many order class materials from the University Bookstore. Is the UI for online purchase effective in allowing users to purchase needed course materials?</p></div>-->

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>This is a student-led project by the Engineers Without Borders club to provide engineering science kits to the Renton School District, with funding from a University group called the Campus Sustainabilty Fund (<a href="https://csf.uw.edu/">csf.uw.edu</a>).</p>
        <p>The overall project is to encourage students to explore engineering and sustainability as a possible university major and eventual career by giving them materials to build a working mini-wind turbine that generates electricity.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="split-box">
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As a member of the club, I served as project lead for this project. I had a range of roles including: developing project specifications, planning the project timeline, directing tasks to club members, writing and designing the teacher's guide, and packing and delivering the completed 40 kits.

    <p>The overall project is to encourage students to explore engineering and sustainability as a possible university major and eventual career by giving them materials to build a working mini-wind turbine that generates electricity.</p> 

<p>This project was from Engineers Without Borders, a student-led club at the University of Washington. The club partnered with Renton School District and secured funding from a university group called the Campus Sustainability Fund.</p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I was the co-lead for this project and one of my roles was to design a manual guiding instructors on how to use the club-designed kits. I wrote most of the content with the rest written by other club members. For the design, I worked solo with some feedback from the other project lead. </p>-->
    <h3>Project Goal Ideation</h3>
        <p>We started the project with the goal <b>to create engineering science kits for kids in the Seattle Children's Hospital</b>. We spent the first couple weeks developing the project goal(s) by doing market research and ideating.</p>
        
        <p>We did market research and a feasibility analysis to get project ideas and develope our final project goal. We focused on viability for user context and viability for club members to aquire materials and manufacture the kit.</p><div class="figs"><img src="ewb-feasibilityAnalysis.png"></div>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b>Final Project Goal: Designing and Delivering Mini Wind Turbine Science Kits to a school.</b></p>
        <p>We settled on this final goal because an electrical engineering-type project would be less messy and give a quicker result than other types (for instance, a chemical engineering would require mixing substances together and waiting for a reaction). We decided on the user environment (a school verses a hospital) as the user would have more space to put the project together, would experience teamwork, and would be able to easily access an instructor for help.</p>
    
    
    <h3>User Needs</h3>
    <div class="split-content-container">
        <div class="left-bar"><p>In developing the kit design, we considered 3 stakeholders: the students, instructors, and the funder, the campus sustainability group.</p> <p>We conferred with our partner, a class coordinator from the Renton School District, for their user needs.</p> <p>Finally, we created a survey to screen for user needs we may have missed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-content">
            <h4>Students</h4><ul>
            <li>-Project should be simple enough to put together for middle-school students.</li>
            <li>-Educational prompts should be succinct and comprehendible for a middle school level.</li>
            <li>-Students should not need to use tools that could be dangerous for them (saws, other power tools, machine shop machines, etc).</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Instructors</h4><ul>
            <li>-Project should require minimal troubleshooting for instructor.</li>
            <li>-Kit teacher's guide should have a minimal page count.</li>
            <li>-Educational prompts should be included to reduce preparation time for instructors.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Sustainability</h4><ul>
            <li>-Use of sustainable materials such as wood or paper instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>-Inclusion of non-consumable items so the kit can be reused for future classes.</li></ul>
            
            <h4>Future Needs</h4>
            <p>Students will complete surveys before and after building the kits to gauge their learning success, enjoyability, and any additional pain points.</p>

    <h3>Design Process Snapshots</h3>

            <h4>Designing the Kits</h4>
            <p>Snapshots of the wind turbine base design progression:</p>
            <span class="split-figs">
                <img src="pvc-ver.png">&#8594;
                <img src="wood-ver.png">&#8594;
                <img src="final-ver.jpeg"></span>
            <p>We started with a pvc plastic design, then switched to recycled wood for sustainability. Our final design was chosen by our partner school district's course coordinator due to ease of storage. </p>
            <h4>The final design</h4>
            <img src="complete-ver.png" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>This box contains 10 mini-wind turbine kits. In total we delivered 4 boxes, or 40 kits to the Renton School District, serving 4 schools in total.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="split-box">
            <h4>Designing the Teacher's Guide</h4>
            <p>This teacher's guide was a set of instructions showing instructors how to use the kit.</p>
            <span class="split-figs size2">
                <img src="manual-img1.JPG" class="mid">&#8594;
                <img src="manual-img2.png" class="mid"></span>
            <p>I started by wireframing on paper, then iterated and finalized the design on Figma.</p>
            <span class="split-figs">
                <img src="manual-img5.png">&#8594;
                <img src="manual-img3.JPG" class="mid">&#8594;
                <img src="manual-img4.png" class="mid"></span>
            <p>One part of the design that involved some problem-solving is how to present the suggested progression through the kit. The cylical progression as well as the lack of space on the page presented a challenge. I started with a wide, circular design with many details (as seen on the left), and decided on a simple, rectangular design.</p>
            <span class="split-figs size2">
                <img src="manual-img6.JPG" class="mid">&#8594;
                <img src="manual-img7.svg" class="mid"></span>
            <p>I also created some vector images for the manual.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--
    <div class="split-content-container">
        <div class="left-bar"><p>I prepared the informational content, set the style direction, then designed the manual by drafting with wireframes and creating the final look with Figma.</p>
        </div>
        
    <div class="right-content"><h4>Informational Content</h4>
    <p>I began by listing out what informational content to include, based on our partner’s needs and requests. One important need was our partner school’s lecture-free teaching style and so I wrote educational prompts for instructors to ask and discuss with students. We focused on using brevity and simple language.</p>
    
    <h4>Style Direction</h4>
    <p>After setting up the content, I set a direction for the style. As a manual-type design, I decided to (visually) reference instruction manuals by creating vector-based images, and to make it clean and simple with a sans serif font and 2-color palette.</p>
    <div class="figs figs-part3">
        <img class="fig fig5" src="assembled%20base.svg"><img class="fig fig6" src="styleCleanSans.png"></div>

    <h4>Content Organization for Usability</h4>
    <p>Then, I roughly organized the content on paper, keeping usability in mind (for instance, the assembly instructions and educational prompts are on the same page, so instructors can teach a class with just 1 page of the guide rather than flipping back and forth). I also focused on keeping the page count low so instructors could concentrate of teaching rather than flipping through the manual.</p>
    <div class="figs figs-part4">
        <img class="fig fig7" src="organizationExample.png"></div>
        
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>I started the design with sketched out wireframes, then moved on to Figma for the final look. I went between sketching and Figma a couple times, reorganizing content for a compact use of space. 
    </p>

    <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>Here is the final design. The school will start using the kits and this manual near the tail end of the 2021-22 school year.</p>

    <h3 class="recs">Reflection</h3>
    <p>One important thing I learned from doing this project is about project goals.</p>
        <p><b>Be very clear when communicating about project goals!</b></p>
    <p>At first, we planned for the educational component on majors and sustainability to be conveyed through a powerpoint presentation. When our partner first mentioned that their classes would rarely have lectures, and would only short ones when they did, we thought they were asked for a short & condensed powerpoint. However, they actually wanted no presentation at all and we pivoted to educational prompts instead where we wrote a set of discussion questions & answers for the instructors. </p>
