    <h3>About this project</h3>
        <p>I designed and coded a 3-page website for a local business which offers coaching services. I also edited and wrote the copy.</p>
        
    <h3>Research Phase</h3>
        <p>I started by doing research on the business; reading past promotional material, and learning about its services and business model. I was provided with the information that the client wanted to go on the website.</p>
        <p>For design inspiration, I looked at websites that pitch a service such as Wordpress, Calendly, and Github. In addition, I picked a central identity to design around: to be clear, simplistic, and soothing.</p>
        
    <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>You can check out the full design by visiting the website <a href="fwwa.net">fwwa.net</a></p>

    <h3>Problem Solving for Clarity</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>The most difficult part of the design was figuring out how to present the topics’ page. The topics were given as one long list which included a wide range of topics and had long, detailed descriptions. Presenting the information as-is would lose viewer attention due to the excess of text and choice overload.</p>
        <h4>My Solution</h4>
        <p>My solution was to chunk the 11 items into 4 topics, decreasing cognitive effort, and to give an overview by using jump links so viewers can get an idea of available topics at a glance. To decrease the text, I gave a description for each topic umbrella rather than each individual topic, and edited the description to be short and concise. Finally, I worked on the type hierarchy to highlight the umbrella and individual topics over the topic description.</p>
