    <h3>About this project</h3>
        <p>I spent one week on each design, with each project made for a different context. The deliverable is a detailed illustration of the final composition and design.</p>
        <p>The 6 prompts are to design: 12 pictographs for travelers; bus shelter panel poster using 2 colors; album cover; movie poster; and 2 more tba (will be updated).
        </p>
        
    <h3>Final Designs</h3>
        <p>The final concept and design that I created for each prompt.</p>
        <p>This list will be updated as the project continues.</p>

    <h3>Design Process Walkthrough- Album</h3>
        <p>I start the design process with reseach. For the album cover, this included visual research into the band’s past covers and other artists’ covers; as well as listening to my subject’s album. In the brainstorming stage, I generated ideas by listing adjectives that describe the emotional pull of the band’s music and album designs. </p>
        <p>In my research, I noticed that the artists’ past covers did not portray himself, or really humans at all. Therefore, I decided to focus on animals, objects, and landscapes. During the brainstorming stage, I decided to focus on conveying hope, optimism, and a whimsical feeling which reflects the music.</p>
        <h4>8 sketches for further concept exploration</h4>
        <div class="size2">

        </div>
        <p>I made 8 sketches to explore ideas. In the end, I hovered on 2 main ideas- to either use a brightly colored sky to emphasize optimism, or to emphasize hope by showing light persevering through darkness. (See the two refined sketches). Although he has songs that exemplify both emotional pulls, proportionally, his music is more upbeat than dark. In addition, the element of whimsicality is lost from the darker “hope” cover. And so, I chose the bright cover for the final look.</p>
